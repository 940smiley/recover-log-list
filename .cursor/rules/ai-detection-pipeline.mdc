---


# ai-detection-pipeline

The AI detection pipeline implements specialized object detection and image processing for collectible items through several integrated components:

## Core Detection Engine (Importance: 92/100)
Path: backend/services/ai.py
- YOLOv8 integration customized for collectible recognition
- Object detection pipeline optimized for:
  - Trading cards
  - Stamps
  - Coins
  - Other collectible memorabilia
- Custom post-processing for collectible-specific attributes

## Image Enhancement Pipeline (Importance: 85/100)
Path: backend/services/image_processing.py
- Collectible-specific preprocessing:
  - Automated border detection and removal
  - Glare reduction for protected items
  - Background separation for display cases
  - Smart cropping based on item boundaries

## Detection Workflow (Importance: 88/100)
Path: backend/routers/ai.py
- Multi-stage detection process:
  1. Initial object detection
  2. Category classification
  3. Condition assessment
  4. Authenticity markers detection
- Parallel processing for batch imports
- Confidence scoring system for collectible identification

## Integration Points (Importance: 75/100)
- Direct connection to import pipeline for automated processing
- Training feedback loop for model improvement
- Real-time detection capabilities for collection management
- Export functionality for detection results
